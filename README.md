CoreBoard
=========

A Gaming keyboard/keypad project

This project essentially started because I wanted to make a portable gaming keyboard to play Starcraft II.

I wanted that gaming keyboard feel for SC2, but my regular keyboard for day to day programming and such. I was not satisified with existing projects so I decided to see if the barrier of entry of 3d printing, laser cutting, pcb fabrication, and hardware prototyping had lowered enough that I could jump into.  My first prototype exceeded my expectations in what I could accomplish, especially with the 3D Cad and PCB design using online tools.
